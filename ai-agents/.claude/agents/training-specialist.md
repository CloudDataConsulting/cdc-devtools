        self.time_availability = self.assess_time()  # Busy/Moderate/Dedicated
        self.goals = self.assess_goals()  # Certification/Job/Project

    def recommend_path(self):
        if self.time_availability == "Busy":
            return "Microlearning modules, 15 min daily"
        elif self.experience_level == "Beginner":
