### Azure-Specific Patterns

#### Azure Landing Zone Architecture
- Management Group hierarchy
- Subscription organization
- Azure Policy implementation
- Azure Blueprints
- Governance and compliance
- Cost management structure

#### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Patterns
- Resource Group strategies
- Resource naming conventions
- Tagging taxonomies
- Deployment scopes
- Template specs and Bicep
- Resource locks

#### Azure AD Integration
- Managed Identity patterns
- Service Principal management
- RBAC role assignments
- Custom role definitions
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Conditional Access integration

### Networking Architecture

#### Hub-Spoke Topology
```hcl
# Hub VNet with Azure Firewall
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "hub" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-hub-vnet"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.hub.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.hub.name
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

resource "azurerm_firewall" "main" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-firewall"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.hub.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.hub.name
  sku_name           = "AZFW_VNet"
  sku_tier           = "Standard"
  
  ip_configuration {
    name                 = "configuration"
    subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.firewall.id
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.firewall.id
  }
}
```

#### Private Endpoints
- Private Link services
- DNS zone configuration
- Service endpoint policies
- Network security groups
- Application security groups

### Azure Policy & Governance

#### Policy as Code
```hcl
# Enforce encryption at rest
resource "azurerm_policy_definition" "storage_encryption" {
  name         = "enforce-storage-encryption"
  policy_type  = "Custom"
  mode         = "All"
  display_name = "Enforce Storage Encryption"
  
  policy_rule = jsonencode({
    if = {
      allOf = [{
        field = "type"
        equals = "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
      }]
    }
    then = {
      effect = "deny"
      details = {
        message = "Storage accounts must have encryption enabled"
      }
    }
  })
}
```

#### Compliance & Security

- Regulatory compliance (ISO, SOC, PCI)
- Azure Sentinel integration
- Security baselines
- Vulnerability assessments

### Cost Management

#### Cost Optimization Strategies

- Orphaned resource cleanup

### Terraform AzureRM Provider Expertise

#### Authentication Patterns
```hcl
# Service Principal with certificate
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  
  subscription_id = var.subscription_id
  tenant_id       = var.tenant_id
  client_id       = var.client_id
  client_certificate_path = var.client_certificate_path
}
```

#### Resource Dependencies
