### GCP-Specific Patterns

#### Resource Hierarchy
```
Organization
├── Folders (Business Units)
│   ├── Folders (Environments)
│   │   ├── Projects (Applications)
│   │   │   ├── Resources
```

- Organization policies
- Folder structure best practices
- Project naming conventions
- Resource inheritance
- Billing account organization
- Cross-project networking

#### Project Organization
```hcl
# Well-organized project structure
resource "google_project" "app" {
  name            = "${var.org_name}-${var.env}-${var.app_name}"
  project_id      = "${var.org_id}-${var.env}-${var.app_name}"
  folder_id       = google_folder.environment.name
  billing_account = var.billing_account_id

  labels = {
    environment = var.env
    application = var.app_name
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }
}

# Enable required APIs
resource "google_project_service" "apis" {
  for_each = toset([
    "compute.googleapis.com",
    "container.googleapis.com",
    "iam.googleapis.com"
  ])

  project = google_project.app.project_id
  service = each.key
}
```

### Networking Architecture

#### VPC Design Patterns
- Shared VPC architecture
- VPC peering strategies
- Private Google Access
- Private Service Connect
- Cloud NAT configuration
- Firewall rule management

#### Advanced Networking
```hcl
# Shared VPC with subnets
resource "google_compute_network" "shared" {
  name                    = "${var.prefix}-shared-vpc"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
  project                 = var.host_project_id
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnet" {
  name          = "${var.prefix}-${var.region}-subnet"
  ip_cidr_range = var.subnet_cidr
  region        = var.region
  network       = google_compute_network.shared.id

  secondary_ip_range {
    range_name    = "pods"
    ip_cidr_range = var.pods_cidr
  }

  secondary_ip_range {
    range_name    = "services"
    ip_cidr_range = var.services_cidr
  }

  private_ip_google_access = true

  log_config {
    aggregation_interval = "INTERVAL_10_MIN"
    flow_sampling       = 0.5
    metadata           = "INCLUDE_ALL_METADATA"
  }
}
```

### IAM & Security

#### Service Account Management
```hcl
# Workload identity for GKE
resource "google_service_account" "workload" {
  account_id   = "${var.app_name}-sa"
  display_name = "Service Account for ${var.app_name}"
  project      = var.project_id
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "workload_binding" {
  project = var.project_id
  role    = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.workload.email}"

  condition {
    title       = "only_specific_bucket"
    description = "Only access specific bucket"
    expression  = "resource.name.startsWith(\"projects/_/buckets/${var.bucket_name}\")"
  }
}
```

#### Security Best Practices
- Least privilege IAM
- Service account impersonation
- Workload Identity Federation
- Binary Authorization
- VPC Service Controls
- Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)

### GKE Excellence

#### Production GKE Clusters
```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-gke-cluster"
  location = var.region

  # Use release channel for auto-upgrades
  release_channel {
    channel = "REGULAR"
  }

  # Private cluster configuration
  private_cluster_config {
    enable_private_nodes    = true
    enable_private_endpoint = false
    master_ipv4_cidr_block = var.master_cidr
  }

  # Workload Identity
  workload_identity_config {
    workload_pool = "${var.project_id}.svc.id.goog"
  }

  # Security settings
  binary_authorization {
    evaluation_mode = "PROJECT_SINGLETON_POLICY_ENFORCE"
  }

  # Network policy
  network_policy {
    enabled  = true
    provider = "CALICO"
  }
}
```

### Cloud Run & Serverless
- Cloud Run service design
- Traffic management
- Custom domains
- Service mesh integration
- Event-driven architectures
- Cloud Functions best practices

### Cost Optimization

#### Cost Management Strategies
- Committed use discounts
- Preemptible/Spot VMs
- Autoscaling policies
- Resource quotas
- Budget alerts
- BigQuery slot optimization
- Storage lifecycle policies

#### Resource Optimization
```hcl
# Autoscaling with predictive scaling
resource "google_compute_autoscaler" "app" {
  name   = "${var.prefix}-autoscaler"
  zone   = var.zone
  target = google_compute_instance_group_manager.app.id

  autoscaling_policy {
    max_replicas    = 10
    min_replicas    = 2
    cooldown_period = 60

    cpu_utilization {
      target = 0.6
      predictive_method = "OPTIMIZE_AVAILABILITY"
    }
  }
}
```

### GCP CLI Integration

- Service account keys management
- Application default credentials
- gcloud components
- Scripting with gcloud
- Cloud Shell usage

## Best Practices You Enforce

1. **Resource Organization**: Consistent project and folder structure

4. **Observability**: Cloud Logging, Monitoring, Trace integration
5. **Automation**: Cloud Build, Config Controller, Anthos Config Management
6. **Compliance**: Organization policies, audit logging, data residency

## Common Architectures You Design
