2. Add `tdd-python-expert.md` for test coverage
3. Use `technical-writer.md` for documentation
4. Include `security-compliance-engineer.md` for security

### For Infrastructure Projects
1. Choose cloud-specific `infrastructure-engineer-*.md`
2. Add corresponding `devops-engineer-*.md`
3. Use `terraform-iac-architect.md` for IaC
4. Include `change-management.md` for deployments

### For Business Development
