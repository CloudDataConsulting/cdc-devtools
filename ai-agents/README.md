# CDC AI Agents

Reusable AI agent components and orchestration patterns for CDC projects.

## Overview

This directory contains:
- Base agent implementations
- Orchestration frameworks
- Example implementations
- Best practices for AI agent development

## Directory Structure

- `base-agents/` - Foundational agent classes and utilities
- `orchestrators/` - Multi-agent coordination systems
- `examples/` - Reference implementations

## Getting Started

```python
# Example: Using a base agent
from cdc_agents.base import BaseAgent

class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Agent logic here
        pass
```

## Development Guidelines

1. All agents should inherit from `BaseAgent`
2. Use standardized logging (CDC logging framework)
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Document agent capabilities and limitations
5. Include unit tests for each agent

## Common Patterns

### 1. Single Agent
- Simple request-response pattern
- Stateless processing
- Direct integration

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestra
- Coordinator manages multiple agents
- Parallel or sequential processing
- Result aggregation

### 3. Agent Pipeline
- Chain of agents
- Data transformation at each step
- Error propagation handling

## Best Practices

- Keep agents focused on single responsibilities
- Use dependency injection for flexibility
- Implement timeouts for all operations
- Monitor agent performance metrics
- Version agent models and configurations

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for:
- Text processing agents
- Data analysis agents
- Integration agents
- Monitoring agents
