# Analyze All Home Directory Configurations for CDC DevTools

Please perform a comprehensive analysis of all configuration files and hidden directories in my home directory to identify additional components that could benefit the CDC DevTools project.

## 1. Scan Home Directory Configuration

Explore my home directory and analyze all hidden files and directories (those starting with `.`):

```bash
# List all hidden files and directories
ls -la ~ | grep "^\."

# For each significant config, examine its contents
```

### Focus Areas:

#### Development Tools
- `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` (beyond what's in .bpruss_config)
- `.gitconfig`, `.gitignore_global`
- `.ssh/config` (structure only, not keys)
- `.tmux.conf`
- `.vimrc`, `.config/nvim/`

#### Language/Framework Specific
- `.npmrc`, `.yarnrc`
- `.pyenv/`, `.python_history`
- `.conda/`, `.condarc`
- `.aws/config` (not credentials)
- `.terraform.d/`
- `.docker/config.json`

#### AI/Claude Related
- `.claude/`, `claude-agents/`
- `.config/claude/`
- `.anthropic/`
- Any AI tool configurations

#### Data Tools
- `.dbt/`
- `.snowsql/`
- `.databricks/`
- Any BI tool configs

#### Shell Enhancements
- `.oh-my-zsh/`
- `.zsh_history` (for common command patterns)
- `.config/` directory contents
- `.local/bin/` (local scripts)

#### Other Potentially Useful
- `.aliases`
- `.functions`
- `.exports`
- `.path`
- Custom tool configurations

## 2. Categorize Findings

Create a report organizing what you find into:

### A. Ready for Team Sharing
Configurations that would immediately benefit all CDC developers:
- Generic productivity aliases
- Useful shell functions
- Tool configurations with good defaults
- Development environment setups

### B. Needs Generalization
Personal configs that could become templates:
- Project paths → Use variables
- Personal credentials → Create placeholders
- Client-specific settings → Make configurable

### C. Valuable Patterns
Not the config itself, but the pattern is useful:
- How I organize projects
- Naming conventions
- Tool combinations
- Workflow automations

### D. CDC-Specific Discoveries
Configurations specifically related to CDC work:
- Client project settings
- CDC-specific aliases or functions
- Team workflow tools

### E. Personal/Skip
Things that should remain personal:
- Personal API keys
- Non-CDC project configs
- Personal preferences with no team benefit

## 3. Extract Hidden Gems

Look for particularly useful items like:
- **Productivity scripts** in `.local/bin/`
- **Custom functions** that automate common tasks
- **Tool integrations** that connect different services
- **Workflow optimizations** that save time

## 4. Create Integration Plan

For each valuable finding, propose:

1. **Where it fits** in CDC DevTools:
   ```
   cdc-devtools/
   ├── developer-config/
   │   ├── shell/
   │   ├── tools/      # Tool-specific configs
   │   │   ├── git/
   │   │   ├── tmux/
   │   │   ├── aws/
   │   │   └── snowflake/
   │   └── languages/  # Language-specific
   │       ├── python/
   │       └── node/
   ```

2. **How to generalize** it for team use

3. **Installation method** (symlink, copy, source)

## 5. Special Attention Areas

### Claude/AI Configurations
If you find any Claude or AI-related configs:
- Analyze how I've organized AI agents
- Look for prompt templates or patterns
- Check for workflow automations
- Extract reusable agent structures

### Data Engineering Tools
Given CDC's focus on data:
- Snowflake configurations
- DBT setups
- AWS data tool configs
- Any ETL/ELT related configs

### Client Management
Look for patterns in how I manage multiple clients:
- Project organization
- Environment switching
- Credential management patterns

## 6. Security Audit

While analyzing, note:
- Any exposed credentials (to fix)
- Good security practices to promote
- Patterns for safe credential management

## 7. Recommendations Report

Create a summary report:

```markdown
# Home Directory Configuration Analysis

## High-Value Discoveries
[List the most valuable configs found]

## Quick Wins
[Configs that can be immediately added to CDC DevTools]

## Integration Opportunities
[Configs that need work but would be valuable]

## New Components to Add
[Suggest new directories/features for CDC DevTools based on findings]

## Security Improvements
[Any security recommendations]
```

## 8. Implementation Priority

Rank the findings by:
1. **Immediate team benefit**
2. **Ease of integration**
3. **Security importance**
4. **Unique to CDC needs**

Please be thorough but also respect privacy - skip anything that looks personal or sensitive. Focus on configurations that would genuinely help the CDC team be more productive!
