# CDC DevTools Project - Session Summary and Continuation

## Project Overview
I'm building CDC DevTools - a comprehensive developer toolkit for Cloud Data Consulting that will be shared across our team. The repository is being created at `~/repos/cdc-devtools` and will be pushed to the CloudDataConsulting GitHub organization.

## Current Status
We've provided Claude Code with several prompts to build out different components. Here's what has been implemented or is in progress:

### 1. Core Structure
- Created base directory structure with tmux-orchestration, ai-agents, monitoring, and team-setup
- Set up bin/ directory with symlinks for easy command access (cdc-create-session, cdc-monitor, etc.)
- All commands prefixed with `cdc-` for consistency

### 2. Tmux Orchestration (Priority Feature)
- Importing and generalizing working tmux session management from the cdc-ai project
- Includes automatic logging with `tmux pipe-pane`
- Session naming pattern: `cdc-[project-name]-[date]`
- Each agent/component gets its own window with automatic logging

### 3. AI Agent Framework
- Base agent classes for reusability
- Imported personal agents from `~/claude-agents/`
- Model router system to optimize Opus vs Sonnet usage based on task complexity
- Usage tracking and analytics for model optimization

### 4. Git Automation
- Automated commits at logical checkpoints
- Smart branching (ai/agent-name/timestamp)
- Detailed commit messages with context
- Git hooks for tracking AI contributions

### 5. Windows Support
- Decided on WSL2-only approach for Windows users
- Created documentation at `docs/WINDOWS_SETUP.md`
- No native Windows support to keep things simple

### 6. Configuration Management
- Currently analyzing `.bpruss_config` to extract team-shareable configurations
- Will generalize personal configs into team templates
- Creating `developer-config/` structure for shared settings
- Personal configs will live in `~/.cdc_config` on user machines

### 7. Home Directory Analysis
- Comprehensive scan of all hidden files/directories in home
- Looking for additional tools, configs, and patterns to share
- Special focus on AI/Claude configs and data engineering tools

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Symlinks in bin/**: All executable commands go through bin/ directory added to PATH
2. **WSL for Windows**: No native Windows support, require WSL2
3. **Model Routing**: Automatic selection of Opus vs Sonnet based on task complexity
4. **Git Automation**: Commits happen automatically, not just on request
5. **Config Philosophy**: Shared configs in repo, personal configs in home directory

## Next Steps

1. Complete the `.bpruss_config` merge
2. Finish home directory analysis
3. Test the complete system
4. Create onboarding documentation
5. Plan rollout to team members

## Active Work
Claude Code is currently working on analyzing and merging the `.bpruss_config` repository into CDC DevTools as a generic configuration system.

## To Continue in New Session
If starting fresh, the next prompt should be:
"Continue working on the CDC DevTools project. We just finished analyzing `.bpruss_config` and extracting team-shareable components. Next, we need to complete the home directory analysis and create the final integration. The project is at `~/repos/cdc-devtools` and we're building a comprehensive toolkit with tmux orchestration, AI agents with model routing, git automation, and team configuration management."

## Repository Location
- Main project: `~/repos/cdc-devtools`
- GitHub: Will be at `github.com/CloudDataConsulting/cdc-devtools`
- Related project to import from: `~/repos/cdc/cdc-ai`
- Personal configs to analyze: `~/.bpruss_config` and home directory
